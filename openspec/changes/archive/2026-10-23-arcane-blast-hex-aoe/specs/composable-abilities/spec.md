# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Ground-Targeted Damaging Abilities and Unified Blast Defense Contests
The combat engine SHALL support damaging abilities (`damageType !== 'NONE'`) declaring `targetType: 'HEX'`. When resolving a damaging hex-targeted ability, the player or AI SHALL be permitted to target any reachable walkable hex in the arena, regardless of whether that hex is occupied or unoccupied.
The attacker SHALL roll a single spellcast attack roll (`d20 + attackModifierAttribute`). The engine SHALL evaluate this attack roll against the individual defense (`defenseTarget`) of every unit located within the blast radius (`aoeRadius`) around the targeted hex (including both enemies and allies, excluding the attacker).
If a unit occupies the center targeted hex, it SHALL contest the attack roll for direct damage using the ability's primary `damageProfile` (eligible for Critical Hit, Solid Hit, Graze, or Miss).
All units located in surrounding hexes within `aoeRadius` SHALL contest the attack roll for secondary splash damage using the ability's declarative `splashDamageProfile` (or fallback base dice if undeclared). Surrounding units that are hit SHALL resolve as a solid hit (or graze), taking splash damage mitigated by their respective armor or ward; surrounding units whose defense exceeds the attack roll SHALL suffer a miss and take 0 damage.
If the center targeted hex is unoccupied, no direct damage event SHALL be emitted, and all units within the surrounding splash radius SHALL contest defense against the attack roll for splash damage.

#### Scenario: Direct hit on occupied center hex with adjacent secondary splash
- **WHEN** an actor executes `Arcane Blast` targeting an occupied hex containing Enemy A, with Enemy B adjacent within 1 hex
- **THEN** a single spellcast attack roll is rolled by the actor
- **THEN** the roll is compared against Enemy A's Resolve, dealing primary damage (`1d4 + Focus`) on a solid hit or critical hit
- **THEN** the roll is compared against Enemy B's Resolve, dealing splash damage (`1d4` flat) if the roll meets or exceeds Enemy B's Resolve, or 0 damage if it misses

#### Scenario: Ground targeting on an empty hex between two enemies
- **WHEN** an actor executes `Arcane Blast` targeting an unoccupied walkable hex adjacent to Enemy A and Enemy B
- **THEN** no direct damage is dealt to the center hex
- **THEN** Enemy A and Enemy B independently compare the spellcast attack roll against their respective Resolve
- **THEN** each enemy that fails the defense contest suffers splash damage (`1d4` flat mitigated by Ward), while any enemy whose Resolve exceeds the roll suffers a miss and takes 0 damage

#### Scenario: Friendly fire damages caught allies
- **WHEN** an ally is positioned within the blast radius of a damaging AoE attack executed by a teammate
- **THEN** the ally contests the spellcast attack roll against their own defense
- **THEN** if the attack roll meets or exceeds the ally's defense, the ally takes splash damage (or center damage if in the center hex) and a damage event is emitted

#### Scenario: High Resolve targets avoid splash damage on low spellcast rolls
- **WHEN** an actor rolls a total spellcast attack roll of 11 on a damaging AoE ability targeting a cluster containing a low-Resolve goblin (Resolve 10) and a high-Resolve golem (Resolve 16)
- **THEN** the goblin suffers splash damage
- **THEN** the golem suffers a miss and takes 0 damage
